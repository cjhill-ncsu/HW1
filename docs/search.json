(Use a markdown list at some point)\n\nI feel that statisticians emphasize more theory, while data scientists are interested in integrating technological tools like machine learning and building useful models.\nBoth aim to derive insights, but data scientists seem to focus more on practical applications as a general notion."

However, I have decided to invest in building a strong foundation in the theory behind the tools we use. In my career, stakeholders often ask “why?” and I found myself lacking the answers. I realized I was using tools to communicate ideas without fully understanding their underlying principles, just because they met certain criteria. I was unable to communicate the necessity of an analysis on a deeper level."
